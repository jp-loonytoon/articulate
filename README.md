# articulate
Articulate word game player

## Synopsis

This is a program that uses a real-time speech recognition system (currently Speechmatics ASR) to allow you to play Articulate (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articulate!).

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

Originally created as part of the Speechmatics (www.speechmatics.com) 2017 Hackathon.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

You should be able to run the application from the command line as 'python3 game.py'.
