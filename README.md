# articulate
Articulate word game player

## Synopsis

This is a program that uses a real-time speech recognition system (currently Speechmatics ASR) to allow you to play Articulate (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articulate!).

## Motivation

Originally created as part of the Speechmatics (www.speechmatics.com) 2017 Hackathon.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The program is written in Python 3, to run it first timeyou'll need to use pip3 install to make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

pip3 install pyyaml

You also need to use the Speechmatics real-time Speech API if you want to use a speech as input. Otherwise you can just feed in text on the command line.


## Installation

Once you've cloned the repository and installed the dependencies, you can run a quick test as follows:

python3 game.py

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

You should be able to run the application from the command line as 'python3 game.py'.
